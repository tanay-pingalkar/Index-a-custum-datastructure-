# Index-a-custum-datastructure-
You can think of it as a better version of array. In array if you want to get key by value, you will need to loop over the whole array and the time complexity becomes O(n). But in my data structure, I tried to make the time complexity as much as constant even if you want to take key by value. That is the magic of Index. That is what I had tried to make.
